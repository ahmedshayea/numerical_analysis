# **Numerical Analysis methods**
This is a collection of programs for *various numerical analysis methods* for *approximating solutions*.

I wrote these programs as a *hobby exercise* when I was taking **Numerical Analysis** course 
at my university.

These are *pure python programs*, no numpy, no scipy, everything has been written from *scratch*
using python.

These are **not meant for real world usage**, they are simply *demonstration* of how you can 
transform mathematical concepts into computer programs.
