# Numerical Analysis methods
This is a collection of programs for varias numerical analysis methods of approximations.

I wrote these programs as a hobby excercise when I was taking Numerical Analysis course 
at my university.

These are pure python programs, no numpy , no scipy, everything has been written from scrach
using python.

These are not meant for real world usage, they are simply demonstration of you can 
transform mathematical concepts and methods into programs.
